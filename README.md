Interactive 3D Solar System Simulation
Welcome to the Interactive 3D Solar System, a web-based simulation that brings our cosmic neighborhood to life right in your browser. Explore the planets, their moons, and other famous celestial artifacts in a fully interactive 3D environment. This project is built with pure JavaScript and the powerful Three.js library for 3D rendering.

Features
* Real-Time 3D Visualization: A beautifully rendered 3D scene of our solar system.
* Complete Orbital Mechanics: All planets and major moons orbit realistically. The simulation speed is adjustable.
* Interactive Camera Controls:
   * POV Switching: Instantly switch between a classic "Default" 3D view and a strategic "Top-Down" view.
   * Orbit Controls: Pan, zoom (with scroll wheel), and rotate the camera to explore from any angle.
   * Reset View: A dedicated button to instantly snap the camera back to the default starting position.
* Time Dilation: A speed slider allows you to control the flow of time, from slow-motion to hyper-speed.
* Discover Famous Artifacts:
   * Asteroid Belt: A procedurally generated asteroid belt orbits between Mars and Jupiter.
   * Tesla Roadster: Track Elon Musk's car on its elliptical orbit around the sun.
   * Voyager 1: See the farthest human-made object on its journey into interstellar space.
* Search & Explore:
   * An "Artifacts" panel provides a complete, searchable list of every object in the simulation.
   * Click any item in the list to have the camera automatically "Find & Follow" it.
* Educational Content:
   * Click on any planet or major artifact to bring up a sleek info card.
   * Cycle through multiple interesting facts for each object with the "Next Fact" button.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
* HTML5: The core structure of the application.
* CSS3 & Tailwind CSS: For modern, responsive styling and UI components.
* JavaScript (ES6 Modules): Powers all the logic, animation, and interactivity.
* Three.js: The heart of the project, a powerful 3D graphics library for creating and rendering the scene in WebGL.
üöÄ How to Use
1. Explore: Use your mouse to click and drag to rotate the view. Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.
2. Learn: Click on any celestial body (planets, moons, etc.) to learn more about it in the info card at the bottom.
3. Control Time: Use the Speed slider in the bottom-right to speed up or slow down the simulation.
4. Change Perspective: Use the Default and Top view buttons in the top-left to change your point of view.
5. Find Anything: Click the Artifacts button in the top-right to open the search panel and find any object in the simulation.
6. Reset: If you ever get lost, click the Reset View button to return to the start.
üîÆ Future Enhancements
* Realistic Textures: Implement a reliable texture loading system for photorealistic planets.
* More Artifacts: Add other famous comets, satellites (like the ISS or Hubble), and space probes.
* Mobile Controls: Improve the user experience with dedicated touch controls for mobile devices.
* Sound Design: Add ambient space music and subtle UI sound effects.
